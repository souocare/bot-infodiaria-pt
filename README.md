# bot-infodiaria-pt
A telegram bot that gives diary information about various things, specially journals first pages of the day, weather, and right now, daily information about Covid-19.

# Why was this project created?
Because I wanted an app, or a bot that I could get all the information about in one place. And specially being automated. 

# How to run it?
Download the files, create a .env file and put all the tokens there (I'll explain above how to do it).
Then, in the terminal, go the the folder where you put your files and write:

```
python3 main.py
```
And then, the program will be running.
